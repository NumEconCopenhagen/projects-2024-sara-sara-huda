# Exam project

Our "Exam project" consists of three Problems *Problem 1: Production economy and CO2 taxation*, *Problem 2: Career choice model*, and *Problem 3: Barycentric interpolation*.


**Methods**
We define three py-files for each problem:
    QUESTION1.py containing the codes for Problem 1.
    QUESTION2.py containing the codes for Problem 2.
    QUESTION3.py containing the codes for Problem 3. 
    scipy.optimize, scipy.interpolate, matplotlib, and numpy are used for numerical analysis as well as visualisation.

**Results**
Our numerical and analytical answers show the equilibrium conditions in a production economy with CO2 taxation, finding the optimal tax and transfer rates that balance output and social welfare in Problem 1. The career choice simulations showed that graduates with more information (friends) make better career decisions, leading to higher realised utility in Problem 2. The barycentric interpolation  approximated values of the given functions within a unit square.


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [examproject.ipynb](examproject.ipynb), which includes the simulations and analyses.

**Dependencies** 
Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
