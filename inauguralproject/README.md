# Inaugural project

Our "Inaugural Project" examines an exchange economy model with an emphasis on illustrating different economic ideas and analyzing market dynamics. We address problems with equilibrium prices, market clearing errors, Pareto improvements, and optimal allocations.

**Methods**
We define the ExchangeEconomyClass, which contains utility maximization, market clearing, and demand calculation methods. scipy.optimize, matplotlib, and numpy are used for numerical analysis as well as visualisation.

**Results**
Our numerical and analytical answers are closely related. We demonstrate Pareto improvements, for example, in an Edgeworth box, displaying feasible allocations that are beneficial to both consumers. In order to determine equilibrium points, we additionally examine market clearing errors over a variety of price ranges. In addition, we find the optimal allocations to maximize customer utility under different constraints.


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb), which includes the simulations and analyses.

**Dependencies** 
Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
