This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from The Danish Central Bank's MONA dataset and show that that higher interest rates suppress economic activity and inflation, with little effect on exchange rates in the Danish economy.
3. Model project. We model the Solow growth model, whilst focusing on how changes in key economic parameters affect long-term growth.
