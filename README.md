This repository contains  

1. Inaugural project. 

2. Data project 

- We fetch data from The Danish Central Bank's MONA dataset and show that that higher interest rates suppress economic activity and inflation, with little effect on exchange rates in the Danish economy.


3. Model project.

- We model the Solow growth model, whilst focusing on how changes in key economic parameters affect long-term growth.


4. Exam project. 

- We solve the three problems given in the exam hand-out.

**Dependencies** 

- Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Folder structure**

- Each project has its own folder within it. Every project's solution consists of a readme file, a python file containing classes and functions, and a notebook from which the project is executed. Each of the four projects from the notebooks located in the appropriate folders should be run.
