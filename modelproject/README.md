# Model analysis project

Our project, titled ''Solow Model Analysis'' explores the Solow growth model, focusing on how changes in key economic parameters affect long-term growth. We analyze the impact of savings rate and depreciation rate on the economy's steady state and dynamic transition.

Methods
We define the SolowModel class, which involves the model's logic, including methods for steady-state computation using scipy.optimize.fsolve, dynamic simulation, and shock application. We use numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pandas for numerical analysis and visualization.

Results
Steady State Analysis: We establish general values for capital, output, consumption, and investment.
Shock Analysis: We examine the effects of temporary and permanent shocks on the model.
Sensitivity Analysis: We analyze how varying the depreciation rate impacts steady state values.
The results can be viewed in the notebook Model_Project_Solow.ipynb, which includes the simulations and analyses.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
