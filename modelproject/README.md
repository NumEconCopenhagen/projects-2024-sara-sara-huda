# Model analysis project

Our project, titled **Real Business Cycle (RBC) Model Analysis**, explores the impact of real (non-monetary) shocks within a classical economic framework using a Real Business Cycle model. This analytical approach allows us to simulate how technology shocks and changes in investment influence the economy over time.

The results of the project can be seen from running Model Project RBC.ipynb, which includes detailed simulations and analyses. The RBCModel class encapsulates the model's logic, including methods for steady-state computation, log-linearization, and economic simulation.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
